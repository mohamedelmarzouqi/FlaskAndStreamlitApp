# Arabic Name Gender Classification API

This project hosts a Flask API for classifying Arabic names by gender using a Random Forest model. You can interact with the API directly or use the Streamlit interface to make classification requests. Additionally, there exists a Docker Compose configuration that orchestrates both the Flask API and the Streamlit interface, simplifying deployment.
